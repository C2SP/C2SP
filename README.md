# Community Cryptography Specification Project

## Motivation

What if we wrote specifications like we write software? C2SP is an experiment to create
usable specifications by following common software methodologies, like semantic versioning.

## Structure

C2SP maintains a collection of specification documents. Each specification is small and
focused, with a limited scope.

Every specification has an assigned maintainer, who is responsible for reviewing and
accepting changes to that specification.

There is a team of stewards that maintains the general repository, assigns and removes
maintainers for specifications, and is the final decision level. Individual maintainers
manage development of specifications on a day-to-day basis.

## Versioning

All specifications use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Since this is normally
intended for software, we adapt it to our specifications with the following semantics:

- 0.Y.Z indicates draft specifications.
  - Bump the version as often as you need!
  - Always bump the minor version on any material change.
- 1.Y.Z indicates "final" specifications, but these are not set in stone.
  - At this point a specification's meaning should not change.
  - Bump the patch version when making changes to the text of a specification (to improve
    it, or fix errata).
  - An extension could be defined in a separate specification, and the "main"
    specification's minor version would be incremented to include the extension.
- 2.Y.Z and above will ideally never be needed! But if we make a mistake in a finalised
  specification, this would be the pathway to recovery.
  - Otherwise these are identical to 1.Y.Z.

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute new specifications or collaborate on existing documents,
in accordance with the [C2SP Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the relevant
licenses.

### Adding a new specification

New specifications are approved by the stewards and assigned to a maintainer.

If you wish to maintain a new spec, open an issue with a `New spec:` prefix.

Pick a meaningful, short name for the specification. This will become part of its URL
(e.g. `https://c2sp.org/short-name`).

### Updating an existing specification

You can either clone this repository and make changes locally, or you can edit a
specification directly in the GitHub UI. In either case, once you are finished, open a
pull request with your proposed updates.
