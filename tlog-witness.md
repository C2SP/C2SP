## Conventions used in this document

The base64 encoding used throughout is the standard Base 64 encoding specified
in [RFC 4648][], Section 4.

`U+` followed by four hexadecimal characters denotes a Unicode codepoint, to be
encoded in UTF-8. `0x` followed by two hexadecimal characters denotes a byte
value in the 0-255 range.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14][] [RFC 2119][] [RFC
8174][] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Introduction

This protocol allows clients, usually logs, to obtain cosignatures from
witnesses, making it possible to produce self-contained inclusion proofs that
can be verified offline. When producing a new checkpoint, the log reaches out to
witnesses to request cosignatures over it, providing a consistency proof.
Witnesses verify that the checkpoint is consistent with their previously
recorded state of the log (if any), and return a timestamped cosignature.

A witness is an entity exposing an HTTP service identified by a name and a
public key. Each witness is configured with a list of supported log public keys.
For each log, uniquely identified by its origin line, the witness is only
required to keep track of the latest checkpoint it observed and verified.

Clients are not expected to communicate directly with the witnesses, logs and
(sometimes) monitors are, but there is no authentication of requests beyond the
validation of the signature on the checkpoint.

Witnesses are designed to scale well with a large number of rarely active logs,
and to support diverse log designs, including low-latency and "serverless" logs,
in order to enable the creation of a public network of interoperable witnesses.

## HTTP Interface

A witness is defined by a name, a public key, and by two URL prefixes: the
*submission prefix* for write APIs and the *monitoring prefix* for read APIs.

A witness MAY use the same value for both the *submission prefix* and the
*monitoring prefix*.

If exposing the machine holding the witness key material directly to the
Internet is undesirable, operators MAY use a [bastion][].

### add-checkpoint

The `add-checkpoint` call is used to submit a new checkpoint to the witness,
along with a consistency proof from a previous checkpoint, and returns the
cosignature.

    POST <submission prefix>/add-checkpoint

The request MUST be an HTTP POST. Clients SHOULD use, and witnesses SHOULD
support, HTTP keep-alive HTTP connections to reduce latency and load due to
connection establishment.

The request body MUST be a sequence of
  - an old size line,
  - zero or more consistency proof lines,
  - and an empty line,
  - followed by a [checkpoint][].

Each line MUST terminate in a newline character (U+000A).

The old size line MUST consist of the string `old`, a single space (0x20),
and the tree size of the previous checkpoint encoded as an ASCII decimal with no
leading zeroes (unless the size is zero, in which case the encoding MUST be `0`).

Each consistency proof line MUST encode a single hash in base64. The client MUST
NOT send more than 63 consistency proof lines.

The submitted checkpoint MAY include multiple signatures.

Example request body:

The witness MUST verify the checkpoint signature against the public key(s) it
trusts for the checkpoint origin, and it MUST ignore signatures from unknown
keys. If the checkpoint origin is unknown, the witness MUST respond with a "404
Not Found" HTTP status code. If none of the signatures verify against a trusted
public key, the witness MUST respond with a "403 Forbidden" HTTP status code.

The old size MUST be equal to or lower than the checkpoint size. Otherwise,
the witness MUST respond with a "400 Bad Request" HTTP status code.

The witness MUST check that the old size matches the size of the latest
checkpoint it cosigned for the checkpoint's origin (or zero if it never cosigned
a checkpoint for that origin). If it doesn't match, the witness MUST respond
with a "409 Conflict" HTTP status code. The response body MUST consist of the
tree size of the latest cosigned checkpoint in decimal, followed by a newline
(U+000A). The response MUST have a `Content-Type` of `text/x.tlog.size`.

If a client doesn't have information on the latest cosigned checkpoint, it MAY
initially make a request with a old size of zero to obtain it.

The consistency proof lines MUST encode a Merkle Consistency Proof from the old
size to the checkpoint size according to [RFC 6962][], Section 2.1.2. The proof
MUST be empty if the old size is zero. If the Merkle Consistency Proof doesn't
verify, the witness MUST respond with a "422 Unprocessable Entity" HTTP status
code.

If the old size matches the checkpoint size, the witness MUST check that the
root hashes are also identical. If they don't match, the witness MUST respond
with a "409 Conflict" HTTP status code.

If the origin is known, and the signature is valid, the witness MAY log the
request even if the consistency proof doesn't verify (but MUST NOT cosign the
checkpoint) as it might be proof of log misbehavior.

If all the checks above pass, the witness MUST update its record of the latest
cosigned checkpoint and respond with a "200 Success" HTTP status code. The
response body MUST be a sequence of one or more [note][] signature lines, each
starting with the `—` character (U+2014) and ending with a newline character
(U+000A). The signatures MUST be [cosignatures][] from the witness key(s) on the
checkpoint.

Example response body:

    — witness.example/w1 CMp+6LWBU0anHGH5aNDTJkH/gj79sG+T6+iP2ThYN5krrDJbR1HDnucjL39QsZTSvVjyQLrdk3DXDqI5G2HgLatVs0pWh6Up69HVOw==
    — witness.example/w1 I7rEps0pvK2UqkS2gSpVUDhrhVtQV9lgF6pRrWAvjJHjyWpW7VcE3SiOlVlbQNt64vWhO+DlkL0+UfzuOBMh9ChdMkP1vi/lCAsmlw==
    — witness.example/w2 AWui8Sk55XjYLOijihBjhqEH6nS1ndDymE0a+6idX7pLcnoB+dhnz0854aLZgrrKbYKA7nC3HNJhm/kWl7oJlqU3rXXvpysAdyP3wQ==

The client MUST ignore any cosignatures from unknown keys. To parse the
response, the client MAY concatenate it to the checkpoint, and use a [note][]
verification function configured with the witness keys it trusts. If that call
succeeds, it can move the valid signatures to its own view of the checkpoint.

The witness MUST persist the new checkpoint before responding. Note that
checking the old size against the latest checkpoint and persisting the new
checkpoint must be performed atomically, otherwise the following race can occur:

1. Request A with size N is checked for consistency.
2. Request B with size N+K is checked for consistency.
3. The stored size is updated to N+K for request B.
4. A cosignature for N+K is returned to request B.
5. The stored size is updated to N for request A, *rolling back K leaves*.
6. A cosignature for N is returned to request A.

### TBD Monitor Retrieval Mechanism

TODO: For a transparency system to be effective, it must not be possible to
partition clients from monitors, either by splitting the tree or by serving a
stale view to monitors. That [may require monitors to obtain more cosignatures
than clients][byzantine-witnesses]. Some logs can facilitate that by fetching a
larger set of cosignatures (e.g. in the background) and serving those to
monitors. Some logs might not be capable of doing that, and might need witnesses
to coordinate directly with monitors. Such a mechanism is still under
discussion, and will have to be designed with an eye towards witness
sustainability.
