Anyone is welcome to contribute new specifications or collaborate on existing
documents, in accordance with the [C2SP Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
the relevant licenses.

Note that when contributing to a certain specification, its maintainers are
responsible for accepting or rejecting changes, and different maintainers may
have different preferences for contributions.

## New specifications

New specifications are approved by a quorum of two stewards and assigned to one
or more maintainers.

If you wish to maintain a new spec, open an issue with a `New spec:` prefix. The
specification proposal must include:

* A description of the specification sufficient to assess its scope. A draft is
  useful but not required.

* The proposed short name matching the regex `[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+`. This will become
  part of its URL (e.g. `https://c2sp.org/short-name`).

* The proposed maintainers.

* The text `/cc @C2SP/stewards`

See [#45](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/issues/45) for an example.

## Tagging new versions

At the moment, there is no automation to tag new versions. Open an issue and cc
@C2SP/stewards. We plan to fix this.
