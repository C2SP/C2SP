# The jq255e and jq255s Groups, Key Exchange and Signatures

  - Version: 0.0.0
  - Author: Thomas Pornin

## Introduction

This document specifies the **jq255e** and **jq255s** groups. These are
prime order groups based on elliptic curves, with characteristics
suitable for building cryptographic protocols:

  - The order of each group is a prime integer close to `2^254`, hence
    formally offering "127-bit security" against discrete logarithm
    attacks.

  - Each group element (including the neutral element) can be encoded as
    a 32-byte sequence. The encoding is canonical: a given element can
    yield only a single possible sequence of 32 bytes, and the decoding
    process verifies that the encoding was done properly. Decoding
    cannot yield an out-of-group element, so that invalid curve attacks
    are not possible, and there are no cofactor issues.

  - Operations on group elements can be implemented with complete
    formulas that have no exceptional case, and are amenable to
    constant-time implementations.

  - Operations are efficient, both on large powerful CPUs and on small
    microcontrollers. The jq255e group is furthermore defined over a
    curve that admits an easily computed non-trivial endomorphism, that
    can be leveraged to further speed up multiplication of group
    elements by scalars.

On top of these groups, the following primitives are specified by this
document:

  - A digital signature scheme. Signatures have size 48 bytes, which is
    shorter than the more usual 64-byte signatures associated with
    elliptic curves of similar security (e.g. EdDSA signatures on
    Curve25519, or ECDSA over P-256 or secp256k1 curves), but still
    provides the security level expected from the curve. Signature
    verification is also faster than with the common 64-byte signatures.

  - A key exchange protocol (Diffie-Hellman).

  - Map-to-curve and hash-to-curve procedures, that allow one-way
    mapping of arbitrary data into group elements with purely
    constant-time implementations.

The underlying curves are specific double-odd curves (curves whose order
is twice an odd integer) interpreted with a coordinate system such that
the curve equation is a Jacobi quartic, as described in the
[double-odd Jacobi quartic whitepaper]. More information on double-odd
curves can be found on the [double-odd elliptic curves Web site].

## Conventions and Notation Used in this Document

  - `x^y` denotes exponentiation of `x` by the integer `y`. This is
    applicable to any type of `x` for which a multiplication operation
    is defined (e.g. integers or finite field elements).

  - Each group is defined over the *finite field* `GF(q)` consisting of
    integers modulo `q = 2^255 - mq` for some small integer `mq` such
    that `q` is prime. For both jq255e and jq255s, `mq < 2^15` so that
    implementations on small microcontrollers remain efficient.

  - The *sign* of a field element `x`, denoted `sgn(x)`, is defined as
    the least significant bit of the binary representation of `x` as
    an integer in the `0` to `q-1` range. Thus, for any `x`:

      - `sgn(x)` is equal to `0` or `1`.
      - If `x = 0`, then `sgn(x) = sgn(-x) = 0`.
      - If `x != 0`, then `sgn(x) = 1 - sgn(-x)`.

    A value `x` is said to be *negative* if `sgn(x) = 1`, or
    *non-negative* if `sgn(x) = 0`.

  - The elliptic curve is the set of points `(e, u)`, with both
    coordinates being elements of `GF(q)` that fulfill the curve
    equation `e^2 = (a^2 - 4*b)*u^4 - 2*a*u^2 + 1`, for two constants
    `a` and `b` that are part of the curve definition. The curve neutral
    point (the "point-at-infinity" which is not actually "at infinity"
    in this coordinate system) is `I = (1,0)`. The curve also contains a
    single point of order 2 denoted `N = (-1,0)`.
    
  - The underlying elliptic curve contains exactly `n = 2*r` points,
    with `r` being a prime integer. The group itself (jq255e or jq255s)
    has order `r`. For both groups, `r` is close to `2^254`.

  - For ease of notation, we define `a' = -2*a` and `b' = a^2 - 4*b`.
    With these constants, the curve equation becomes:
    `e^2 = b'*u^4 + a'*u^2 + 1`

  - A *group element* is defined as a pair `{ P, P+N }` for any curve
    point `P`. The points `P` and `P+N` are the two possible
    *representants* of the group element. The group law is denoted
    additively: for any two group elements, their sum is computed by
    simply adding together their representant points over the curve;
    since `N` has order 2, it does not matter which representants are
    used. The encoding process uses, for each group element, a specific
    representant, and automatically computes it if given the other
    representant, so that the encoded format is canonical. Similarly,
    group element equality abstracts away the representants.

  - Integers modulo `r` are called *scalars*. Since `r` is prime, the
    scalars constitute a finite field. Group elements can be multiplied
    by scalars: for a scalar `s` and a group element `P`, the product is
    `s*P = P + P + ... + P`, where the group law is applied `si - 1`
    times (with `si` being the integer representant of `s`, in the `0`
    to `r-1` range).

The jq255e curve parameters are the following:

```
jq255e:

  q = 2^255 - 18651
  a = 0
  b = -2
  a' = -2*a      = 0
  b' = a^2 - 4*b = 8
  equation: e^2 = 8*u^4 + 1
  group order: r = 2^254 - 131528281291764213006042413802501683931
  curve order: n = 2*r
  conventional generator: G = (eg, ug)
     eg = -3
     ug = -1
```

For jq255s, the curve parameters are as follows:

```
jq255e:

  q = 2^255 - 3957
  a = -1
  b = 1/2 = 2^254 - 1978
  a' = -2*a      = 2
  b' = a^2 - 4*b = -1
  equation: e^2 = -u^4 + 2*u^2 + 1
  group order: r = 2^254 + 56904135270672826811114353017034461895
  curve order: n = 2*r
  conventional generator: G = (eg, ug)
     eg = 6929650852805837546485348833751579670837850621479164143703164723313568683024
     ug = 3
```

## Group Element Operations

In this section, practical procedures for computing point operations are
presented using pseudocode in a syntax compatible with the Python language
and the [SageMath] mathematics system. This syntax closely follows the
abstract mathematical notation otherwise used in this document, with the
following exceptions:

  - Exponentiation uses the `**` operator (instead of `^`).
  - Points with extended coordinates `(E:Z:U:T)` become
    tuples `(E,Z,U,T)`.

The pseudocode assumes that the following functions are available:

  - `GFq(j)` converts the integer `j` to a field element by reducing
    `j` modulo `q`.

  - `int(x)` converts the field element `x` into an integer by using its
    unique representant in the `0` to `q-1` range.

  - `half(x)` divides the field element `x` by two. It is usually
    implemented by a right-shift by 1 bit, then the conditional addition
    of the constant `(q+1)/2` if the dropped bit was non-zero. Such an 
    implementation is considered to be a "fast" operation (i.e. at least
    as fast as an addition in the field).

  - `invert(x)` returns the multiplicative inverse of `x` in the field.
    Zero has no multiplicative inverse, but it is sometimes convenient
    for constant-time implementations to return `0` as a (formal) inverse
    of `0`; this is obtained naturally if inversion is implemented using
    Fermat's Little Theorem (i.e. raising `x` to the power `q-2`). This
    feature is not needed for the formulas described in this document.

  - `sgn(x)` returns the "sign" of `x`, as defined previously: the
    sign is the value of the least significant bit of `int(x)`.

  - `sqrt(x)` returns either a square root of `x` (if `x` is indeed
    a square in the finite field), or `False` (if `x` is not a square
    in the finite field). **Important:** when `x` is a square, the
    returned square root is non-negative.

  - `is_square(x)` returns `True` if `x` is a square in the finite field,
    or `False` otherwise.

  - `scalar_to_int(s)` and `int_to_scalar(j)` compute the same
    operations as `int()` and `GFq()`, respectively, but for scalars,
    which are integers modulo the prime `r`.

  - `secure_random(m)`, for an integer `m >= 1`, returns a sequence
    of `m` random bytes obtained from a cryptographically secure source,
    with a uniform probability distribution. This is used only for
    private key generation in the specification of high-level protocols.

If an addition, subtraction or multiplication uses as operands a field
element and an integer (usually small), then the integer is first
implicitly converted to a field element as if by using `GFq()`. In
practice, the implementation may provide a dedicated
multiply-by-small-integer function; on usual software platforms, such an
operation is about as fast as an addition in the field.

The implementation of `sqrt(x)` depends on the used field. For jq255s,
the field is such that `q = 3 mod 4`, which allows a simple square root
implementation by computing the square root candidate `z = x^((q+1)/4)`.
For jq255e, the field is such that `q = 5 mod 8`, which can be handled
with Atkin's algorithm:

 1. Compute: `c = (2*x)^((q-5)/8)`
 2. Compute: `d = 2*x*c^2`
 3. Compute the square root candidate: `z = x*c*(d - 1)`

The obtained candidate MUST be checked (by comparing `z^2` with `x`).
Moreover, if `z` is indeed a square root of `x`, then it MUST be
normalized to a non-negative value (i.e. if `sgn(z) = 1`, then `z` must
be replaced with `-z`). The use of this fixed convention for square
roots is needed for proper interoperability of the map-to-group and
hash-to-group operations.

`is_square(x)` can be implemented as a simple wrapper around `sqrt(x)`,
though faster implementations are possible with the [Legendre/Jacobi
symbol][]. A fast, constant-time implementation of that operation can be
obtained as a straightforward derivative of the [optimized binary
GCD][]; on some small microcontrollers, this `is_square()`
implementation can be about six times faster than the full square root
computation.

### Affine Formulas

We recall here the affine formulas applicable to points on double-odd
Jacobi quartic curves. Implementations are expected to use the extended
representation described later on in this document; the affine formulas
are potentially useful if some alternate point representations are
explored.

For any point `P = (e, u)` on the curve, the point `P+N` (i.e. the other
representant of the same group element) is `P+N = (-e, -u)`. The
*opposite* of the point `P` is `-P = (e, -u)`. The neutral element of
the group is `{ I, N }` (i.e. `I = (1, 0)` and `N = (-1, 0)` are the two
representants of the group neutral).

Let `P1 = (e1, u1)` and `P2 = (e2, u2)` be two points on the curve. Their
sum `P3 = P1 + P2 = (e3, u3)` can be computed as follows:

```
     (1 + b'*u1^2*u2^2)*(e1*e2 + a'*u1*u2) + 2*b'*u1*u2*(u1^2 + u2^2)
e3 = ----------------------------------------------------------------
                          (1 - b'*u1^2*u2^2)^2

      e1*u2 + e2*u1
u3 = ----------------
     1 - b'*u1^2*u2^2
```

These formulas are *complete*: they work on all pairs of curve points,
including the points `I` and `N` (that represent the neutral element).

The Jacobi quartic curve `e^2 = b'*u^4 + a'*u^2 + 1` is birationally
equivalent to the curve with Weierstraß equation `y^2 = x*(x^2 + a*x + b)`
with the following mappings (defined for all points excepts `I` and `N`):

```
x = (e + 1 - a*u^2)/(2*u^2)
y = x/u

e = (x^2 - b)/(x^2 + a*x + b)
u = x/y
```

On the Weierstraß curve, `N` has coordinates `(0, 0)`, and `I` has no
defined coordinates (it is then truly "at infinity"). The Weierstraß
equation can then be converted to a *short Weierstraß equation*
`Y^2 = X^3 + A*X + B` by using the following:
```
A = (3*b - a^2)/3
B = a*(2*a^2 - 9*b)/27
X = x + a/3
Y = y
```

Converting to Weierstraß coordinates and back is not required for
implementing the jq255e and jq255s groups; such coordinates have
furthermore special cases for the points `I` and `N`. These conversions
may be useful in some specific contexts, e.g. to leverage preexisting
generic implementations of (short) Weierstraß curves, if only for
testing purposes.

### Extended Coordinates

In order to reduce the number of field element divisions (which are
usually quite expensive in software implementations, relatively to
additions and multiplications), the following internal representation is
recommended: a point `P = (e, u)` is represented by the quadruplet
`(E:Z:U:T)` of field elements, with the following rules:

  - `Z != 0` (in all cases)
  - `e = E/Z`
  - `u = U/Z`
  - `u^2 = T/Z` (i.e. `U^2 = T*Z`)

These coordinates are called *EZUT coordinates*.

The points `I` and `N`, which represent the neutral element in the group,
have coordinates `(Z:Z:0:0)` and `(-Z:Z:0:0)`, respectively, for any
field element `Z != 0`. It does not matter, for correct computations, which
of `I` or `N` is used to represent the neutral; similarly, any non-zero `Z`
can be used.

*Extended affine coordinates* are a special case of extended coordinates
where `Z = 1` (in which case, `E = e`, `U = u` and `T = u^2`). Such
coordinates are appropriate for use in fixed precomputed tables of
points, e.g. small multiples of the conventional generator; setting `Z = 1`
for such points reduces the table size in memory, and allows for some
shortcuts in operations on these points.

*Jacobian coordinates* are used transiently in point-doubling formulas.
They are hereafter called *XWJ coordinates*. They relate to the `(x, y)`
coordinates of curve points when using the Weierstraß equation `y^2 =
x*(x^2 + a*x + b)`. For a point `(x, y)`, its XWJ coordinates are a
triplet `(X:W:J)` such that:

  - `W != 0`
  - `x = W/(J^2)`
  - `w = y/x = W/J`

The points `I` and `N` can be represented on XWJ coordinates with the
triplets `(W^2:W:0)` and `(0:W:0)`, respectively, for any `W != 0`. For
all curve points other than `I` and `N`, the coordinate `J` is non-zero.
In general, Jacobian coordinates do not lead to efficient and complete
point addition formulas, but they offer fast and complete formulas for
point doublings. Thus, a strategy for computing a sequence of several
successive point doublings is to convert the source point from EZUT to
XWJ coordinates, compute the doublings in XWJ, then convert the result
back into EZUT coordinates.

### Encoding and Decoding

A group element, represented by the point `P = (E:Z:U:T)`, can be
encoded unambiguously into a field element `v` as follows:

```python
def group_to_field(P):
    (E, Z, U, T) = P
    iZ = invert(Z)
    v = iZ*U
    if sgn(iZ*E) == 1:
        v = -v
    return v
```

Here, `iZ*U` and `iZ*E` are the `u` and `e` coordinates, respectively.
The group element is really encoded as the `u` coordinate of the
representant point whose `e` coordinate is non-negative.

The decoding process rebuilds either the original `P`, or the other
representant `P+N` of the same group element:

```python
def field_to_group(v):
    t = v**2
    delta = (a**2 - 4*b)*(t**2) - 2*a*t + 1
    E = sqrt(delta)       # Note: sqrt() returns the non-negative root
    if E is False:
        return False
    Z = GFq(1)
    U = v
    T = t
    return (E, Z, U, T)
```

The `field_to_group(v)` function returns a representant of the (unique)
group element that encodes to the value `v`, or `False` if there is no
such element. Take care that `sqrt()` MUST return the non-negative root.

**Note:** The decoding process naturally returns a point in (extended)
affine coordinates (`Z = 1`).

### Point Addition

The sum of two group elements is computed by adding the respective
representants of the elements on the curve. In EZUT coordinates, the
points `P1` and `P2` are added as follows:

```python
def point_add(P1, P2):
    (E1, Z1, U1, T1) = P1
    (E2, Z2, U2, T2) = P2
    ap = -2*a              # The constant a'
    bp = a^2 - 4*b         # The constant b'
    e1e2 = E1*E2
    z1z2 = Z1*Z2
    u1u2 = U1*U2
    t1t2 = T1*T2
    tz = (Z1 + T1)*(Z2 + T2) - z1z2 - t1t2
    eu = (E1 + U1)*(E2 + U2) - e1e2 - u1u2
    hd = z1z2 - bp*t1t2
    E3 = (z1z2 + bp*t1t2)*(e1e2 + ap*u1u2) + 2*bp*u1u2*tz
    Z3 = hd**2
    T3 = eu**2
    U3 = half((hd + eu)**2 - Z3 - T3)   # Alternatively: U3 = hd*eu
    return (E3, Z3, U3, T3)
```

If the point `P2` is in extended affine coordinates, i.e. such that `Z2`
is statically known to be equal to 1, then the multiplication `Z1*Z2`
can be avoided, and the computation of `tz` simplifies to `Z1*T2 + T1`.
This specific case is known as a *mixed addition* and is typically
encountered when multiplying the conventional generator by a scalar,
using precomputed tables of small multiples of the generator.

### Point Negation and Subtraction

Given the point `P = (E:Z:U:T)`, its opposite is obtained as
`-P = (E:Z:-U:T)`, i.e. simply negating the `U` coordinate in the field.
The subtraction of `P2` from `P1` can be obtained by adding `-P2` to
`P1`.

```python
def point_neg(P):
    (E, Z, U, T) = P
    return (E, Z, -U, T)

def point_sub(P1, P2):
    return point_add(P1, point_neg(P2))
```

### Point Doublings

Suppose that we have `k >= 1` successive doublings to perform on an
input point `P` (i.e. we want `(2^k)*P`). The general strategy is
the following:

  - Perform the first doubling with formulas that receive `P` in
    EZUT coordinates, and output `2*P` in XWJ coordinates.
  - Perform the other `k-1` doublings in XWJ coordinates.
  - Convert the final result from XWJ to EZUT.

Depending on the used curve, it can be beneficial to combine some of
these doublings with a switch to the other representant (i.e. computing
`2*P+N` instead of `2*P`); this does not change the output as a group
element, since we are free to use either of the two representants.

Two distinct functions, described below, are used for computing sequences
of doublings on jq255e and jq255s, each leveraging the specific definition
of the curve to achieve better performance. The subsequent pseudocode
will assume that the correct implementation for the current curve is
accessible under the generic function name `point_xdouble()`.

#### On jq255e

Given a jq255e element represented by point `P`, and integer `k >= 1`,
the following function computes `k` successive doublings:

```python
def point_xdouble_jq255e(P, k):
    (E, Z, U, T) = P

    # P (EZUT) -> 2*P (XWJ)
    s = E**2
    X = s**2
    W = 2*(Z**2) - s
    J = 2*(E*U)

    # k-1 times P (XWJ) -> 2*P (XWJ)
    for _ in range(1, k):
        s1 = W**2
        s2 = s1 - 2*X
        s3 = s2**2
        X = s3**2
        J = J*((W + s2)**2 - s1 - s3)   # Alternatively: J = 2*J*W*s2
        W = s3 - 2*(s1**2)

    # Conversion XWJ -> EZUT
    Z = W**2
    T = J**2
    U = half((W + J)**2 - Z - T)        # Alternatively: U = J*W
    E = 2*X - Z
    return (E, Z, U, T)
```

#### On jq255s

Given a jq255s element represented by point `P`, and integer `k >= 1`,
the following function computes `k` successive doublings:

```python
def point_xdouble_jq255s(P, k):
    (E, Z, U, T) = P

    # P (EZUT) -> 2*P+N (XWJ)
    s = U**2
    X = 8*(s**2)
    W = 2*s - (T + Z)**2
    J = 2*(E*U)

    # k-1 times P (XWJ) -> 2*P+N (XWJ)
    for _ in range(1, k):
        s1 = W*J
        s2 = s1**2
        s3 = (W + J)**2 - 2*s1
        J = 2*s1*(2*X - s3)
        X = 8*(s2**2)
        W = 2*s2 - s3**2

    # Conversion XWJ -> EZUT
    Z = W**2
    T = J**2
    U = half((W + J)**2 - Z - T)        # Alternatively: U = J*W
    E = 2*X - Z - T
    return (E, Z, U, T)
```

### Element Equality

The following function determines whether two points `P1` and `P2`
represent the same group element:

```python
def same_element(P1, P2):
    (E1, Z1, U1, T1) = P1
    (E2, Z2, U2, T2) = P2
    return U1*E2 == U2*E1
```

This function handles all cases properly, including when one or both
of the operands represent the group neutral.

A consequence is that a point `P = (E:Z:U:T)` represents the neutral
element in the group if and only if `U = 0`.

### Field to Point Map

We define two field-to-point maps (for jq255e and jq255s, respectively)
which turn a given field element into a group element (really, a curve
point) such that the discrete logarithm of the output relatively to the
conventional generator is unknown. These maps can be implemented in an
efficient and safe (constant-time) way.

The two jq255e and jq255s curves use distinct implementations, shown
below. The subsequent pseudocode will assume that the correct
implementation for the current curve is available under the name
`map_to_jq255()`.

#### On jq255e

This map uses the constant `sqrtm1 = sqrt(-1)` on the field. Since there are
two such square roots modulo `q`, we conventionally use the non-negative
root, i.e.:

```
sqrtm1 = 7656063742463026568679823572395325799027601838558345258426535816504372595438
```

The field element `f` is mapped to a point as follows:

```python
def map_to_jq255e(f):
    if f == GFq(0):
        return (GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))   # 0 is mapped to the neutral
    x1 = 4*(f**2) - 7
    x2 = (4*(f**2) + 7)*sqrtm1   # sqrtm1 is the non-negative square root of -1
    x0 = 4*f
    z1 = 64*(f**7) + 176*(f**5) - 308*(f**3) - 343*f
    z2 = -sqrtm1*(64*(f**7) - 176*(f**5) - 308*(f**3) + 343*f)
    y0 = 8*(f**2)
    if is_square(z1):
        (x, xx, y, yy) = (x1, x0, sqrt(z1), y0)
    elif is_square(z2):
        (x, xx, y, yy) = (x2, x0, sqrt(z2), y0)
    else:
        (x, xx, y, yy) = (x1*x2, x0**2, sqrt(z1*z2), y0**2)
    (u, uu) = (x*yy, xx*y)
    (X, XX) = (-8*(u**2), uu**2)
    (U, UU) = (2*x*xx*uu, u*(x**2 - 8*(xx**2)))
    (E, EE) = (X**2 + 2*(XX**2), X**2 - 2*(XX**2))
    return (E*(UU**2), EE*(UU**2), U*UU*EE, (U**2)*EE)
```

A constant-time implementation can be achieved by delaying the test
`f == 0` until the end of the computation, and performing a constant-time
conditional overwrite of the result with `(GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))`
in that case. Similarly, `is_square(z1)` and `is_square(z2)` would be
systematically computed, and constant-time conditional move operations
performed to get the appropriate operand to the (single) `sqrt()`
operation, and also set the `x`, `xx`, `y` and `yy` variables
appropriately.

### On jq255s

On jq255s, we use the Elligator2 map. The field element `f` is mapped to
a point as follows:

```python
def map_to_jq255s(f):
    if f == GFq(1) or f == GFq(-1):
        return (GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))
    z1 = -2*(f**6) + 14*(f**4) - 14*(f**2) + 2
    z2 = -z1*(f**2)
    xx = 1 - f**2
    if is_square(z1):
        (x, y) = (GFq(-2), sqrt(z1))
    else:
        (x, y) = (2*(f**2), -sqrt(z2))
    if y == GFq(0):
        return (GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))
    (u, uu) = (x*xx, y)
    (X, XX) = (2*(u**2), uu**2)
    (U, UU) = (2*uu, x**2 + xx**2)
    (s1, s2) = (X*(2*X - XX), XX*(X - XX))
    (E, EE) = (s1 + s2, s1 - s2)
    return (E*(UU**2), EE*(UU**2), U*UU*EE, (U**2)*EE)
```

As with jq255e, a constant-time implementation is achieved by delaying
the handling of exceptional cases until the end of the function, and
using constant-time conditional moves to get the right operand for the
`sqrt()` operation and set the `x` and `y` values.

### Point Multiplication by a Scalar

A group element `P` can be multiplied by a scalar `s` through the usual
double-and-add and variant algorithms that leverage the point addition
and doublings exposed above.

An efficient and constant-time implementation can be obtained with a
window optimization and recoding of the scalar:

  - A given *window width* `w` is chosen; `w` is expressed in bits.
    Usual values are 4 or 5 (the optimal value depends on the relative
    performance of the various operations in a given implementation;
    `w = 5` is typically best, though `w = 4` may be preferred in
    small microcontrollers with severe constraints on RAM usage).

  - The scalar is converted to an integer in base `2^w`, with *signed*
    digits in the `-(2^(w-1)-1)` to `+2^(w-1)` range (nclusive). This is
    easily done as follows (a process known as Booth recoding):

     1. Split `s` into `w`-bit chunks, each with an unsigned integer
        value between `0` and `(2^w)-1`.
     2. Modify each digit in least-to-most significant order: if a digit
        has a value greater than `2^(w-1)`, subtract `2^w` from it,
        and add 1 to the next digit.

    Since `r` is very close to `2^254`, and assuming that the source scalar
    was properly reduced (i.e. it was converted to an integer in the `0`
    to `r-1` range), it can be shown that Booth recoding yields at most
    `ceil(255/w)` digits, and the most significant digit is necessarily
    non-negative.

  - Compute a window (table) of small multiples of the source point `P`,
    containing `j*P` for `j = 1` to `2^(w-1)`.

  - Perform a double-and-add algorithm over the signed digits in
    most-to-least significant order:

     1. Set an accumulator element `R` corresponding to the most significant
        digit, i.e. to the group neutral if the digit is zero, or by
        looking up the value in the window otherwise.

     2. Process all other digits in most-to-least significant order.
        For each digit `d`, first multiply `R` by `2^w` (using
        the `point_xdouble()` function); then, look up point `Q = d*P`
        (if `d = 0`, then `Q` is the group neutral; if `d > 0`, then
        the point `Q` is found in the window; if `d < 0`, find `(-d)*P`
        in the window and negate it to get `Q`) and add `Q` to `R`.

  - `R` contains the result (`s*P`) once all digits have been processed.

```python
def point_mul(P, s):
    # Build window: win[i - 1] = i*P  (with i = 1 to 16)
    win = []
    win.append(P)
    for i in range(2, 16, 2):
        P2 = point_xdouble(win[(i >> 1) - 1], 1)
        P3 = point_add(P, P2)
        win.append(P2)
        win.append(P3)
    win.append(point_add(P, win[14]))

    # Booth recoding of the scalar with a 5-bit window
    j = int(s)
    sd = []
    cc = 0
    for i in range(0, 51):
        nd = (j & 31) + cc
        j >>= 5
        if nd > 16:
            sd.append(nd - 32)
            cc = 1
        else:
            sd.append(nd)
            cc = 0

    # Point multiplication itself
    if sd[50] == 0:
        R = (GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))
    else:
        R = win[sd[50] - 1]
    for i in reversed(range(0, 50)):
        if sd[i] > 0:
            Q = win[sd[i] - 1]
        elif sd[i] < 0:
            Q = point_neg(win[(-sd[i]) - 1])
        else:
            Q = (GFq(1), GFq(1), GFq(0), GFq(0))
        R = point_xdouble(R, 5)
        R = point_add(R, Q)
    return R
```

This process becomes constant-time if all the steps are constant-time.
In particular, the lookup process from the window must then scan *all*
elements from the window systematically, and select the correct one with
constant-time conditional move operations that use bitwise Boolean
operations.

### Scalar Split and Curve Endomorphism on jq255e

The curve over which the jq255e group is defined is a special type of
curve known as a GLV curve: there exists an easily computed non-trivial
endomorphism on the curve (which is thus a group homomorphism on the
jq255e group). This endomorphism can be leveraged to speed up the
generic point multiplication by a scalar (cost of the operation is
typically reduced by about 25 to 30%).

The endomorphism is expressed as the function `zeta()`:

```
zeta(e, u) = (e, u*sqrtm1)
```

with `sqrtm1` being the non-negative square root of -1 in the field:

```
sqrtm1 = 7656063742463026568679823572395325799027601838558345258426535816504372595438
```

This is the same value `sqrtm1` which was already used in the specification
of the `map_to_jq255e()` function. In `(x, y)` coordinates on the
corresponding Weierstraß equation, the `zeta()` function returns
`(-x, sqrtm1*y)`.

In EZUT coordinates, `zeta()` is computed as `zeta(E:Z:U:T) =
(E:Z:sqrtm1*U:-T)`. It can be shown that applying `zeta()` to a group
element yields exactly the same group element as multiplying by a given
scalar `mu`, which happens to be a square root of -1 in the scalar field
(integers modulo `r`). With the value of `sqrtm1` defined above, the
value of `mu` is:
```
mu = 23076176648693837106500022901799924463072024427516564762134831823525232195341
```

**Note:** The value `mu` is here defined for *group elements*. When
applied to a *curve point*, we have `zeta(P) = mu*P + N`. Since we work
on the prime order group jq255e and do not care about which representant
of the output group element we obtain, we can ignore that extra `+N`.

Any given scalar `s` can be split into two half-width signed integers
`s0` and `s1`, such that `s = s0 + mu*s1`, and the absolute values of
`s0` and `s1` are both at most equal to `sqrt(r)`. In particular, they
both fit on 128 bits each, as signed integers, including the sign bit.
The splitting process can be done efficiently with operations on plain
integers; it involves some rounded divisions, but these can be
simplified into only multiplications and shifts thanks to the specific
value of the group order `r`. For details, refer to the [double-odd
elliptic curves whitepaper][] (section 6.2). Once `s` has been split
into `s0` and `s1`, the double-and-add algorithm described in the
previous section can be modified with *two* windows, the second window
containing points `zeta(j*P)`, and only half the number of point
doublings.

## High-Level Protocols

*High-level protocols* are signatures, key exchange and hash-to-group
operations. We specify here how these operations are performed, and
in particular all encoding rules and handling of invalid inputs.

The primitives below use the [BLAKE2][] hash function, specifically
its BLAKE2s variant with a 32-byte (256-bit) output. The pseudocode
expects the following API (which is compatible with Python's standard
`hashlib`):

  - `sh = hashlib.blake2s()` creates an object `sh` that incarnates
     a new BLAKE2s computation.

  - The data to hash is provided in one or several chunks of arbitrary
    length. Each chunk is a sequence of bytes.

  - `sh.digest()` finalizes the computation and returns the 32-byte
    BLAKE2s output.

### Encoding Rules

All encodings here are expressed in terms of *bytes*. We use the term
"byte" to denote what is, formally speaking, an *octet* (a group of
eight bits). A byte has a numerical value in the 0 to 255 range. The
least significant bit of the byte has weight 1, while the most
significant bit has weight 128.

Encoding formats are fixed-size sequences of bytes. Within a sequence,
the first byte has index 0, the next byte has index 1, and so on;
thus, the last byte of a 32-byte sequence has index 31.

#### Field Elements

A field element `x` is encoded as a fixed 32-byte sequence using the
unsigned little-endian convention:

```python
def field_encode(x):
    return int(x).to_bytes(32, byteorder='little')
```

In other words:

  - The field element is considered as an integer `z` in the `0` to `q-1`
    range.
  - For `j = 0` to `31`, output byte of index `j` is set to the
    integer value `bb[j] = floor(z / (256^j)) mod 256`.

Since `q` is slightly below `2^255`, the last output byte (index 31)
necessarily has value at most 127, which means that the most significant
bit of that byte is necessarily equal to 0.

When decoding, the following rules MUST be observed:

  - The decode MUST reject as invalid any input sequence whose length
    is not exactly 32 bytes.
  - The integer value `z` must be recomputed by taking into account
    all input bytes completely. In particular, the most significant
    bit of the last byte MUST NOT be ignored.
  - The recomputed `z` MUST be checked to be lower than `q`. Any
    implicit or explicit reduction modulo `q` is incorrect. If
    `z >= q`, then the decoder MUST reject the input.

The following function implements these rules:

```python
def field_decode(bb):
    if len(bb) != 32:
        return False
    z = int.from_bytes(bb, byteorder='little')
    if z >= q:
        return False
    return GFq(z)
```

Any application or outer protocol may reuse the most significant bit of
the last byte to store some other data element, provided that the bit is
restored to its proper value (0) before giving the byte sequence as
argument to `field_decode()`.

#### Scalars

Scalars are integers modulo `r`. They follow the same rules as field
elements, except that they work with the modulus `r` instead of `q`:

```python
def scalar_encode(x):
    return scalar_to_int(x).to_bytes(32, byteorder='little')

def scalar_decode(bb):
    if len(bb) != 32:
        return False
    z = int.from_bytes(bb, byteorder='little')
    if z >= r:
        return False
    return int_to_scalar(z)
```

For jq255e, `r` is slightly below `2^254`, so the two most significant bits
of the last byte of the encoding are always zero. As with the decoding
of field elements, the scalar decoder MUST NOT ignore either or both of
these two bits. For jq255s, only the most significant bit is guaranteed
to be zero, since `r`, for that curve, is slightly *above* `2^254`.

#### Group Elements

Group elements are encoded to bytes by first encoding them to field
elements, then encoding the field elements to bytes:

```python
def group_encode(P):
    return field_encode(group_to_field(P))

def group_decode(bb):
    v = field_decode(bb)
    if v is False:
        return False
    return field_to_group(v)
```

**Note:** When decoding, both the decoding of the bytes to a field
element, and the decoding of the field element to a group element, may
fail (i.e. return `False`). If a strictly constant-time process is
required, that does not even leak whether the process succeeded or not,
or the cause of the failure, then the test on the output of the
`field_decode()` call can be delayed until the end of the function,
invoking `field_to_group()` on some conventional value in that case.

#### Private Keys

A *private key* is a secret non-zero scalar. Private keys are encoded
as scalars, with the additional provision that, upon decoding, a key
of value zero is rejected.

```python
def private_key_encode(sk):
    return scalar_encode(sk)

def private_key_decode(bb):
    sk = scalar_decode(bb)
    if sk is False:
        return False
    if sk == int_to_scalar(0):
        return False
    return sk
```

To *generate* a private key, a non-zero scalar should be chosen from a
cryptographically secure source. If the `secure_random(m)` function
returns `m` random bytes with uniform probability, then the following
function produces a new private key:

```python
def private_key_generate():
    while True:
        kb = secure_random(32)
        sk = int_to_scalar(int.from_bytes(kb, byteorder='little'))
        if sk != int_to_scalar(0):
            return sk
```

**Note:** This function generates a random 256-bit integer, then reduces
it modulo `r` (through the `int_to_scalar()` function). Since the value
of `r`, in both jq255e and jq255s, is very close to a power of two, then
this process induces only negligible bias; in the general case, one
would need to produce a source integer substantially larger than `r`
(e.g. 384 bits), but this is not required for jq255e and jq255s. Using a
source 256-bit integer means that the reduction modulo `r` can be
implemented in a simple way, without requiring a generic big integer
division routine.

The `private_key_generate()` function is organized as a loop so that the
returned private key is guaranteed not to be zero. However, the
probability that a zero private key value is obtained is negligible;
hence, only one iteration of the loop will be used in practice.

#### Public Keys

A *public key* is a non-neutral group element. The public key `Q`
corresponds to the private key `sk` such that `Q = sk*G`, with `G` being
the conventional generator. A public key is decoded and encoded as a
group element, with the additional provision that, upon decoding,
the neutral element is rejected.

```python
def public_key_encode(Q):
    return group_encode(Q)

def public_key_decode(bb):
    Q = group_decode(bb)
    if Q is False:
        return False
    (E, Z, U, T) = Q
    if U == GFq(0):
        return False
    return Q
```

The public key corresponding to the private key `sk` can be computed by
invoking `point_mul(G, sk)`, with `G` being the conventional generator
element.

### Signatures

A **signature** is computed over a given input message, using a private
key; the signature value has size exactly 48 bytes. The correctness of
the signature value over a given message can be verified against the
public key corresponding to the private key used for signing.

Internally, a Schnorr signature process is used; the challenge value is
computed with the [BLAKE2][] hash function. Specifically, the BLAKE2s
function is used, with a 32-byte output (as will be described below,
that 32-byte output is then truncated to 16 bytes, but the hash output
length 32 is still used in the BLAKE2 parameter block).

In this section, we use the following notations:

  - The signer's private key is `sk`.

  - The signer's public key is the group element `Q = sk*G`.

#### Input Message

The input message can be *raw* (an arbitrary sequence of bytes) or
*pre-hashed* (a hash value). In all operations below, we use the
*prepared message* `M` defined as follows:

  - If the input is raw, then `M` consists of a single byte of value
    `0x52`, followed by the input bytes.

  - If the input is a hash value `hv`, then `M` is obtained as the
    concatenation of, in that order:

      - A single byte of value `0x48`.

      - The symbolic name of the hash function that was used to produce
        `hv`, encoded in ASCII.

      - A single byte of value `0x00` (which terminates the encoded hash
        function name).

      - The have value `hv`.

The following symbolic hash function names are defined:

| Hash function | symbolic name |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| SHA-256       | sha256        |
| SHA-384       | sha384        |
| SHA-512       | sha512        |
| SHA-512/226   | sha512256     |
| SHA3-256      | sha3256       |
| SHA3-384      | sha3384       |
| SHA3-512      | sha3512       |
| BLAKE2s       | blake2s       |
| BLAKE2b       | blake2b       |
| BLAKE3        | blake3        |

In the table above, "BLAKE2s" and "BLAKE2b" are to be understood as
"BLAKE2s with a 32-byte (256-bit) output" and "BLAKE2b with a 64-byte
(512-bit) output", respectively. In general, the symbolic name of a hash
function is obtained by converting the hash function human-readable name
to lowercase and removing all characters which are neither letters or
digits.

```python
def prepare_message_raw(msg):
    return b'\x52' + msg

def prepare_message_prehashed(hv, hashname):
    return b'\x48' + hashname.encode() + b'\x00' + hv
```

The **recommended usage** is to apply jq255e and jq255s signatures on
input messages pre-hashed with BLAKE2s with a 32-byte (256-bit) output.
The signature scheme shall be designated, formally, as follows:

  - **jq255e** and **jq255s**: signatures are computed over the
    input message pre-hashed with BLAKE2s-256 (i.e. BLAKE2s with a
    32-byte output).

  - **jq255e-raw** and **jq255s-raw**: signatures are computed over
    the raw input message, with no pre-hashing.

  - **jq255e-hashname** and **jq255s-hashname**: signatures are computed
    over the input message pre-hashed with the hash function whose
    *symbolic name* is "hashname". Thus, "jq255e-sha256" means
    "signature with the jq255e group, computed over an input message
    pre-hashed with SHA-256".

Thus, "jq255e", as a signature scheme name, is equivalent to
"jq255e-blake2s".

The following remarks apply:

  - Regardless of the hash function used to pre-hash the message (if any),
    the *internal* hash function used to compute the challenge is always
    BLAKE2s. Within the scope of this specification, the use of BLAKE2s
    internally is not configurable.

  - Using a raw input conceptually provides additional protection
    against collision attacks on weak hash functions. On the other hand,
    raw inputs are not compatible with some kinds of streamed processing,
    forcing either the sender or the recipient of a signed message to
    buffer the entirety of the signed data. This is why pre-hashing with
    a properly collision-resistant hash function is recommended in
    general.

#### Signature Generation

A signature is computed with the following general process:

  - A *per-signature nonce* `k` is produced. This is a secret scalar
    that is chosen with uniform probability, and used only for a single
    signature.

  - A *commitment* is computed as the group element `R = k*G`.

  - A *challenge* is computed by hashing together the commitment `R`,
    the public key `Q`, and the prepared message `M`, yielding a
    value `c`.

  - The *response* is the scalar `s = k + c*sk` (interpreting `c` as
    an integer which is then converted to a scalar).

The signature value itself consists of `c` and an encoding of `s`.

The signature generation process is described as the `sign()` function
below, using the private key (`sk`), public key (`Q`) and prepared
message (`M`) as input. That function calls the `generate_nonce()`
function to generate `k` in a safe and deterministic way; that process
uses an extra optional parameter called `seed`. More on this function
is detailed later on.

```python
def generate_nonce(sk, Q, M, seed):
    sh = hashlib.blake2s()
    sh.update(private_key_encode(sk))
    sh.update(public_key_encode(Q))
    sh.update(len(seed).to_bytes(8, byteorder='little'))
    sh.update(seed)
    sh.update(M)
    bb = sh.digest()
    return int_to_scalar(int.from_bytes(bb, byteorder='little'))

def make_challenge(R, Q, M):
    sh = hashlib.blake2s()
    sh.update(group_encode(R))
    sh.update(public_key_encode(Q))
    sh.update(M)
    return sh.digest()[0:16]  # 32-byte output is truncated to 16 bytes

def sign(sk, Q, M, seed):
    k = generate_nonce(sk, Q, M, seed)
    R = point_mul(G, k)
    c = make_challenge(R, Q, M)
    ic = int.from_bytes(c, byteorder='little')
    s = k + sk*int_to_scalar(ic)
    return c + scalar_encode(s)    # Concatenation of c and encoded s
```

The `make_challenge()` function returns a 16-byte value. The signature
value is the concatenation of `c` and the encoded scalar `s`, for
a total length of 48 bytes.

The per-signature nonce `k` is a scalar. The nonce may conceptually have
value zero (though this is very improbable); thus, the commitment `R`
may be the neutral element. This is why `R` must be encoded with
`group_encode()` and not `public_key_encode()` (public keys *cannot* be
the neutral element).

The `generate_nonce()` function incarnates a process known as
*derandomization*. Generally speaking, the nonce `k` should be generated
randomly and uniformly among all possible scalar values. Any bias in
this selection process may lead to private key reconstruction attacks.
If a cryptographically secure random generator is available, then `k`
may be obtained by simply getting 32 bytes out of that generator,
interpreting them as a 256-bit integer, then reducing that integer
modulo `r` (as in the private key generation process, this induces only
negligible bias since `r` is close enough to a power of two). However,
in practical implementations, a properly secure random generator is not
necessarily available at signature generation time; the
`generate_nonce()` function instead uses the private key, public key,
message and optional extra seed to produce `k` in a safe way without
requiring a random generator.

The `seed` parameter is optional. If set to a fixed value (e.g. the
empty byte sequence, of length 0), then `generate_nonce()` is fully
deterministic (the same signature value is always obtained for a given
message and a given private key); this is safe. However, additional
protection against some active attacks that introduce glitches in the
computation through physical means can be obtained with some
non-determinism. Such non-determinism is achieved by adding some varying
bytes as `seed`. The security does not depend on the randomness of the
seed; a randomly generated seed with a non-secure generator, or even a
fully predictable seed, such as a sequence number or the current time,
still yields a fully safe per-signature nonce.

The ability to provide the seed explicitly allows for testing the
nonce generation process through test vectors. Since `generate_nonce()`
encodes the seed length (in bytes) over 8 bytes, the seed may be
an arbitrary sequence of up to `2^64-1` bytes.

#### Signature Generation

A signature `sig` is verified against a public key `Q` and a prepared
message `M` with the following process:

```python
def verify(Q, sig, M):
    if len(sig) != 48:
        return False
    c = sig[0:16]
    s = scalar_decode(sig[16:48])
    if s is False:
        return False
    cc = int_to_scalar(int.from_bytes(c, byteorder='little'))
    R = point_sub(point_mul(G, s), point_mul(Q, cc))   # R = s*G - c*Q
    c2 = make_challenge(R, Q, M)
    return c == c2       # Comparison of two 16-byte sequences
```

The `make_challenge()` function defined in the signature generation
process is here used again during the verification. In a nutshell,
the process boils down to recomputing the commitment `R` from the
challenge `c` and response `s` (found in the signature), and checking
that the correct challenge can be recomputed from `R`, `Q` and `M`.

The scalar `s` can be split into a low and a high halves (`s0` and `s1`,
respectively), with `s = s0 + s1*(2^128)`, which allows rewriting the
computation of `R` as:
```
R = s0*G + s1*((2^128)*G) + c*(-Q)
```
which is a linear combination of three points (`G`, `(2^128)*G` and `Q`)
with coefficients that all fit on 128 bits each. In a double-and-add
alglorithm, the point doublings for the three multiplications can be
mutualized, using Straus's method (also colloquially known as "Shamir's
trick"). The points `G` and `(2^128)*G` are fixed constants; appropriate
tables of small multiples of these points can be generated in advance
(and can furthermore be normalized to affine points). This method yields
a fast signature verification implementation, even faster than a single
generic multiplication of a point by a full-width scalar. Additional
speed improvements can be achieved with some non-constant-time techniques
such as w-NAF scalar encodings, under the assumption that signature
values and public keys are public data and thus can be processed without
maintaining a strict constant-time discipline.

#### Signature Security

The signatures described above formally provide the same security level
as the group itself, i.e. "127 bits" (arguably equivalent to "128 bits"
in the same sense as, for instance, Curve25519 is argued to offer
"128-bit security" with a subgroup order of "only" about `2^252`
elements). The use of a half-width challenge `c` was already suggested
by Schnorr in his seminal paper; the security properties and requirements
on the hash function (here, BLAKE2s) were thoroughly analyzed by [Neven,
Smart and Warinschi][].

It has been [noted][] that while the construction with a half-width
challenge is safe *as a signature scheme*, some advanced protocols try
to also use signatures as commitments on a unique message: these
protocols assume that it is infeasible for the signer to produce a
public key `Q`, a signature `sig` and two distinct messages `M0` and
`M1` such that `verify(Q, sig, M0)` and `verify(Q, sig, M1)` both return
`True`. With the half-width challenges used in the signature scheme
specified here, it is possible to produce such `Q`, `sig`, `M0` and `M1`
with effort about `2^64` operations (i.e. a substantial but not
infeasible computation). Formally speaking, the scheme achieves normal
unforgeability but not semi-strong unforgeability. This does *not*
contradict non-repudiation: in such a scenario, the signer truly signed
both messages `M0` and `M1`, and can truthfully be held accountable to
both. However, this lack of message unicity can complicate and even
formally weaken some protocols such as distributed threshold signature
schemes with some potentially actively dishonest signers. For "normal"
usages of signatures (e.g. for authentication or certification
purposes), this is a non-issue.

### Key Exchange

A *Diffie-Hellman key exchange* is defined here. Two parties (party 1
and party 2) generate private/public key pairs (sk1 and Q1 for party 1,
sk2 and Q2 for party 2). Each party receives a copy of the public key of
the other party, and combines it with its own private key to produce a
secret key (of size 32 bytes). If the public keys were computed
correctly and not altered in transit, then both parties compute the same
secret key, and that key is not known to outsiders. It can then be used
for further cryptographic operations, typically symmetric encryption.

**Warning:** Two important caveats apply:

  - The key exchange described here does not, by itself, ensure
    authentication. An active attacker in position to intercept messages
    exchanged between the two parties may replace public keys on the
    wire with values generated by the attacker, and establish distinct
    secret keys, but both known to the attacker, with each party. The
    attacker may then decrypt and re-encrypt subsequent messages as they
    flow. A Diffie-Hellman key exchange may provide security against
    active attackers only if integrated into an outer protocol that
    ensures proper authentication (e.g. SSL/TLS uses signatures and
    certificates on top of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange).

  - While private and public keys used here have the same format as
    private and public keys used for signatures, it is **not
    recommended** to use the same private/public key pair for both key
    exchange and signatures. In general, the two activities call for key
    pairs with distinct, incompatible lifecycle properties (simply put,
    keys used for encryption should normally be backed up to prevent
    data loss in case of key loss, while keys used for signatures must
    not be backed up, since their value relies in their exclusive
    control by the purported signer). Moreover, possible interactions
    between the two schemes are not entirely explored.

The process below describes how a party uses its own key pair (`sk` and
`Q`) along with the *encoded* public key received from the peer
(`peer_pk`) to compute the shared secret. The function returns two
values: the computed secret key (presumably shared with the peer), and a
Boolean status. The status is set to `False` if the bytes sent by the
peer cannot be decoded as a proper public key. When the peer bytes are
invalid, a secret key is still computed, and it is not guessable by
outsiders. The point of producing such a fake secret key is to allow the
use of the key exchange in some (rather contrived) scenarios in which
attackers cannot *see*, but can *alter* public keys in transit, and may
obtain some extra information from knowledge of whether the altered key
was valid or not. Computing a fake but indistinguishable secret key can
provide this extra security feature. In most normal uses of
Diffie-Hellman, that feature is not needed.

```python
def ECDH(sk, Q, peer_pk):
    # Decode the peer public key from the received bytes.
    peer_pk_good = True
    peer_Q = public_key_decode(peer_pk)
    if peer_Q is False:
        peer_Q = G
        peer_pk_good = False

    # Compute the shared point.
    P = point_mul(peer_Q, sk)
    eP = group_encode(P)

    # Get the two encoded public keys, in lexicographic order.
    pk1 = public_key_encode(Q)
    pk2 = peer_pk
    ipk1 = int.from_bytes(pk1, byteorder='big')
    ipk2 = int.from_bytes(pk2, byteorder='big')
    if ipk1 > ipk2:
        (pk1, pk2) = (pk2, pk1)

    # Compute the shared secret key.
    sh = hashlib.blake2s()
    sh.update(pk1)
    sh.update(pk2)
    if peer_pk_good:
        sh.update(b'\x53')    # One byte of value 0x53
        sh.update(eP)
    else:
        sh.update(b'\x46')    # One byte of value 0x46
        sh.update(private_key_encode(sk))
    return (sh.digest(), peer_pk_good)
```

The derivation of the shared secret group element `P` into a secret key
appropriate for further symmetric cryptograhic operations uses an
invocation of the BLAKE2s hash function. The two exchanged public keys
are also used as input to the hashing process; since both parties should
obtain the same key, the two public keys are inserted in lexicographic
order (lowest key first). The pseudocode applies lexicographic ordering
by interpreting both sequences of bytes as integers with the
*big-endian* notation, and then comparing them as integers; when using
languages without direct access to big integers, a simple byte-by-byte
comparison may also be performed.

### Hash-to-Group

A hash-to-group process maps an arbitrary input (sequence of bytes) to a
group element, such that the output distribution is indistinguishable
from uniform random selection. In particular, no information is obtained
about the discrete logarithm of the output with regard to any given
fixed generator element.

The input data is first turned into a *prepared message* using the
same process as in the signature scheme. As such, the hash-to-group
process is thus implicitly computed over the raw data, or a
pre-hashed message. It is **recommended** to use pre-hashing with
the BLAKE2s hash function (with a 32-byte output); unless specified
explicitly otherwise, the "hash-to-jq255e" and "hash-to-jq255s"
functionalities assume that pre-hashing with BLAKE2s is applied. As will
be made apparent below, the prepared message `M` is itself hashed twice,
so that using a raw message can entail some large overhead if the input
is very large.

```python
def hash_to_group(M):
    sh = hashlib.blake2s()
    sh.update(b'\x01')      # One byte of value 0x01
    sh.update(M)
    bb1 = sh.digest()
    f1 = GFq(int.from_bytes(bb1, byteorder='little'))

    sh = hashlib.blake2s()
    sh.update(b'\x02')      # One byte of value 0x02
    sh.update(M)
    bb2 = sh.digest()
    f2 = GFq(int.from_bytes(bb2, byteorder='little'))

    Q1 = map_to_jq255(f1)   # Using map_to_jq255e() or map_to_jq255s()
    Q2 = map_to_jq255(f2)   # Using map_to_jq255e() or map_to_jq255s()
    return point_add(Q1, Q2)
```

**Note:** Here, the two 32-byte values `bb1` and `bb2`. which are
obtained as hash outputs, are interpreted as 256-bit integers which are
then implicitly reduced modulo `q`; this is unlike unlike
`field_decode()`, the latter function rejecting out-of-range inputs
instead.

**Rationale:** The two invocations of BLAKE2s could be replaced with a
single hashing operation, provided that a hash value with a 64-byte
output is used. We prefer to use BLAKE2s here, because most standard
hash functions with a 64-byte output (e.g. SHA-512 or BLAKE2b)
internally use large states and operations on 64-bit integers that do
not map well to the abilities of small microcontrollers.
