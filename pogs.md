# Prime Order Group (POG) Signatures

[c2sp.org/pogs](https://c2sp.org/pogs)

This document defines the Prime Order Group (POG) signature scheme, a variant of Schnorr signatures
that can utilize any prime-order group and cryptographically-secure hash function that functions as
a random oracle.

# Cryptographic Dependencies

POG signing depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

- Prime-order Group, {{dep-pog}};
- Cryptographic hash function, {{dep-hash}};

These are described in the following sections.

## Prime-Order Group {#dep-pog}

POG signatures depend on an abelian group of prime order `p`. We represent this
group as the object `G` that additionally defines helper functions described below. The group operation
for `G` is addition `+` with identity element `I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `G`,
`A + B = B + A` is also a member of `G`. Also, for any `A` in `G`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. For convenience, we use `-` to denote
subtraction, e.g., `A - B = A + (-B)`. Scalar multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation on an element A with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted
as `r*A = A + ... + A`. For any element `A`, `p * A = I`. We denote `B` as a fixed generator
of the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated application of the group
operation `B` with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of
scalars corresponds to `GF(p)`, which we refer to as the scalar field. This document uses types
`Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements of the group `G` and its set of scalars, respectively.
We denote equality comparison as `==` and assignment of values by `=`.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on `G`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `G` (i.e. `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity `Element` of the group (i.e. `I`).
- RandomScalar(): Outputs a random `Scalar` element in GF(p).
- SerializeElement(A): Maps an `Element` `A` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to an `Element` `A`,
  and fails if the input is not a valid byte representation of an element of
  the group. This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails
  or `A` is the identity element of the group; see {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific
  input validation steps.
- SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar `s` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to a `Scalar` `s`.
  This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails; see
  {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific input validation steps.

## Cryptographic Hash Function {#dep-hash}

POG signatures require the use of a cryptographically secure hash function, generically written as
H, which functions effectively as a random oracle. For concrete recommendations on hash functions
which SHOULD be used in practice, see {{ciphersuites}}. See {{ciphersuites}} for more details.


The output signature (R, z) MUST be encoded as follows (using notation from {{Section 3 of TLS}}):

~~~
  struct {
    opaque R_encoded[Ne];
    opaque z_encoded[Ns];
  } Signature;
~~~

Where Signature.R_encoded is `G.SerializeElement(R)` and Signature.z_encoded is
`G.SerializeScalar(z)`


## Verify

This section contains a routine for verifying Schnorr signatures with validated inputs.
Specifically, it assumes that signature R component and public key belong to the
prime-order group.

~~~
  prime_order_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, a byte string
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from signature generation
  - PK, public key, an Element

  Outputs: 1 if signature is valid, and 0 otherwise

  def prime_order_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(z)
    r = R + (c * PK)
    return l == r
~~~

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A POG ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group details
and cryptographic hash function. Each ciphersuite is denoted as (Group, Hash),
e.g., (ristretto255, SHA-512). This section contains some ciphersuites.

The DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar functions instantiated for a
particular prime-order group corresponding to a ciphersuite MUST adhere
to the description in {{dep-pog}}. Validation steps for these functions
are described for each the ciphersuites below. Future ciphersuites MUST
describe how input validation is done for DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar.

## POG(ristretto255, SHA-512) {#recommended-suite}

This ciphersuite uses ristretto255 for the Group and SHA-512 for the Hash function `H`.
The value of the contextString parameter is "POG-RISTRETTO255-SHA512-v5".

- Group: ristretto255 {{!RISTRETTO=I-D.irtf-cfrg-ristretto255-decaf448}}
  - Order: 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493 (see {{RISTRETTO}})
  - Identity: As defined in {{RISTRETTO}}.
  - RandomScalar: Implemented by repeatedly generating a random 32-byte string and
    invoking DeserializeScalar on the result until success.
  - SerializeElement: Implemented using the 'Encode' function from {{!RISTRETTO}}.
  - DeserializeElement: Implemented using the 'Decode' function from {{!RISTRETTO}}.
  - SerializeScalar: Implemented by outputting the little-endian 32-byte encoding of
    the Scalar value.
  - DeserializeScalar: Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a 32-byte
    string. This function can fail if the input does not represent a Scalar between
    the value 0 and `G.Order() - 1`.

- Hash (`H`): SHA-512, and Nh = 64.
  - H1(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "rho" || m) and mapping the
    output to a Scalar as described in {{!RISTRETTO, Section 4.4}}.
  - H2(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "chal" || m) and mapping the
    output to a Scalar as described in {{!RISTRETTO, Section 4.4}}.
  - H3(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "digest" \|\| m).
  - H4(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "nonce" || m) and mapping the
    output to a Scalar as described in {{!RISTRETTO, Section 4.4}}.

## POG(P-256, SHA-256)

This ciphersuite uses P-256 for the Group and SHA-256 for the Hash function `H`.
The value of the contextString parameter is "FROST-P256-SHA256-v5".

- Group: P-256 (secp256r1) {{x9.62}}
  - Order: 0xffffffff00000000ffffffffffffffffbce6faada7179e84f3b9cac2fc632551
  - Identity: As defined in {{x9.62}}.
  - RandomScalar: Implemented by repeatedly generating a random 32-byte string
    and invoking DeserializeScalar on the result until success.
  - SerializeElement: Implemented using the compressed Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String
    method according to {{SECG}}.
  - DeserializeElement: Implemented by attempting to deserialize a public key using
    the compressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point method according to {{SECG}},
    and then performs partial public-key validation as defined in section 5.6.2.3.4 of
    {{!KEYAGREEMENT=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Ar3}}. This includes checking that the
    coordinates of the resulting point are in the correct range, that the point is on
    the curve, and that the point is not the point at infinity. Additionally, this function
    validates that the resulting element is not the group identity element.
    If these checks fail, deserialization returns an error.
  - SerializeScalar: Implemented using the Field-Element-to-Octet-String conversion
    according to {{SECG}}.
  - DeserializeScalar: Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a 32-byte
    string using Octet-String-to-Field-Element from {{SECG}}. This function can fail if the
    input does not represent a Scalar between the value 0 and `G.Order() - 1`.

- Hash (`H`): SHA-256, and Nh = 32.
  - H1(m): Implemented using hash_to_field from {{!HASH-TO-CURVE=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve, Section 5.3}}
    using L = 48, `expand_message_xmd` with SHA-256, DST = contextString || "rho", and
    prime modulus equal to `Order()`.
  - H2(m): Implemented using hash_to_field from {{!HASH-TO-CURVE, Section 5.3}}
    using L = 48, `expand_message_xmd` with SHA-256, DST = contextString || "chal", and
    prime modulus equal to `Order()`.
  - H3(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "digest" \|\| m).
  - H4(m): Implemented using hash_to_field from {{!HASH-TO-CURVE, Section 5.3}}
    using L = 48, `expand_message_xmd` with SHA-256, DST = contextString || "nonce", and
    prime modulus equal to `Order()`.
